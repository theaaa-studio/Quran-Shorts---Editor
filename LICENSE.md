## License

**My intent (plain English):**

- ✅ Anyone can **use, copy, modify, and share** this editor.
- ✅ You can **contribute improvements** — please keep copyright and license notices intact.
- ❌ **Do not sell** this software, offer it as a paid service, or repackage it and claim it as your own.
- ❌ **No misrepresentation** of authorship.

To reflect that intent, the code is licensed under the **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0**.

> Add a `LICENSE` file at the repo root with the verbatim text: [https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/)
>
> Note: PolyForm Noncommercial is **not** OSI‑approved open source because it **disallows commercial use**. That’s intentional to prevent resale while still enabling broad community use and updates.

### If you want a different policy later

You can switch or dual‑license in the future (e.g., keep Noncommercial for most users and grant paid commercial licenses by exception). If you want to open it fully for businesses, consider one of the alternatives below.

### Common license options (quick guide)

- **MIT / Apache‑2.0** → Most permissive for software. ✔ Commercial use and resale allowed (with attribution; Apache also includes patent terms). Use if you want maximum adoption, including commercial.
- **GPL‑3.0** → Strong **copyleft**. ✔ Commercial use allowed, but **derivatives must also be open‑sourced under GPL**. Use if you want improvements to stay open.
- **BSL 1.1 (Business Source)** → **Source‑available** with a time‑delayed switch to an OSI license; **production/commercial** use restricted until the change date. Use if you want a path to open source later.
- **CC BY‑NC 4.0** → Good for **content** (not code). Non‑commercial only, attribution required. Use for bundled **media/templates**, not for the software itself.
- **CC0 / Unlicense** → Public‑domain‑equivalent. ✔ Anything goes, including resale. Use only if you want zero restrictions.
- **PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0** _(chosen)_ → **Non‑commercial** use, modification, and sharing allowed; **no selling** or paid services; keep notices and don’t misrepresent authorship.

## Note on Generated Videos & Data Source Licenses

The **Noncommercial** license applies **only to this codebase**. Your exported videos include content from **EveryAyah**, **Quran.com**, and **AlQuran Cloud** and are governed by **their** licenses/policies.

**In practice:**

- ▶️ The editor’s Noncommercial clause does **not automatically** restrict your video outputs.
- ⚖️ You **must** follow each source’s terms for redistribution, attribution, and monetization.
- 💡 If the sources allow it, you **may publish or monetize** your exported videos — even though the editor itself is non‑commercial software.

When in doubt, please review the current terms on EveryAyah, Quran.com, and AlQuran Cloud before publishing.
